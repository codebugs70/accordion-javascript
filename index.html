            Finally, for Checking, Betterment Financial LLC receives a portion
            of interchange fees from merchants whenever you use your debit card
            (just like any bank or credit union), and a small portion of the net
            interest margin from deposits in your account. We don't earn revenue
            from any funds we've selected for your portfolio. We also don't make
            money in our trading practices. That's all because we're built to
            align Betterment's interests with your own.
